# DeCairesFaceMask
 
 This is a custom face mask using an imported face tracking library.  
 
 
 **Explanation of Mask** 
 
 The mask includes the Venezuelan in the form of a hand and it disintegrates over time as the program runs. It does so symbolizing my personal connection to my home country as the years have passed and I have been away for longer and longer.
 
 
 Included in the repository are some of the images of masks I used for inspiration as well as preliminary drawings.
